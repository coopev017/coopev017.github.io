## About Me

I am a recent graduate from Western Washington University where I completed a Bachelor's of Science in mathematics, accompanied by minors in phyics and astronomy. In order to gain some experience, I have also completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate which provided me with a solid foundation of the data analysis process and skill set. My education has allowed me to realize my love and interest for science and deep curiousity for the unknown and mysteries of the universe. I enjoy the process and outcomes of problem solving and reaching conclusions due to critical thinking and diligence, especially when the outcomes and conclusions are a surprise or unexpected. I have learned it takes a lot of mental endurance and grit to accomplish ones goals and push through what seems like the impossible. I am determined to pave my way, through math, science, data, where ever I may go. I am determined to make a difference.  
  
I am passionate about my own learning and only wish to continue to learn in all that I do. I do believe that learning never stops and growth never stops. I seek for an environment where change is a driving element and where courage, diverse ideas and passion are encouraged.  
### Goal

At this time, I aim to grow and improve these skills mentioned by working through case studies of various topics in order to become a well-rounded analyst. I will be experimenting and dabbling in different skills in each case study to, all while working with topics I love and have interest in. 
My goal is not perfection, it is improvement. 
I aim to become a well-rounded data analyst and a data interpreter.
I hope to be given an opportunity that allows me to further my knowledge and continously grow and change for the better.

#### Statement of Originality
Here, I am to post insights and conclusions based on data from open source databases. This work is my own and the origins of the data will be posted with each case study. Thank you.

## Projects

### Netflix Project
Started 08/05/2021  
*Last updated: 08/05/2021*  
**Context**  
I am wanting to complete a project where I can practice the data analysis steps and also build a small program that may allow a user to explore the data themselves.  
My first step is to clean and process the data. I feel it is at a well presentable stage now, which I will post here for safekeeping, however, it is subject to change and I will update accordingly.
My next step will be to perform some statistical analysis and start asking some simple questions that will hopefully lead to more indepth questions and valuable insights!  
Stay tuned for updates :)

### SDSS Case Study
Uploaded 06/12/2021  
*Last updated: 06/11/2021*  
**Context**  
In this case study, my motivation was to explore skills I obtained during the certificate I earned. I wanted to do this while also researching a topic that I thoroughly enjoy. By no means is this an immaculate case study, but I wanted to see what I could do on a fairly basic level, and I had fun working through it.

### Bella Beat Case Study
Uploaded 06/12/2021  
*Last updated 05/03/2021*  
**Context**  
This case study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone Project. The scenario was given by the curriculum and it was my task to find trends and pattern in a secondary sources data that may help Bella Beat spot opportunities in its own products. As this is my very first case study, I am content with how it came out, however I do hop to revisit this prompt in the future in order to gauge improvement.
