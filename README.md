### About Me

I am a recent graduate from Western Washington University where I completed a Bachelor's of Science in mathematics, accompanied by minors in phyics and astronomy. My education has allowed me to realize my love and interest for science and deep curiousity for the unknown and mysteries of the universe. I enjoy the process and outcomes of problem solving and reaching conclusions due to critical thinking and diligence, especially when the outcomes and conclusions are a surprise or unexpected. I have learned it takes a bit of mental endurance and grit to accomplish ones goals and push through what seems like the impossible. I am determined to pave my way, through math, science, data, where ever I may go. I am determined to make a difference.  
  
I have also recently completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate in order to gain some hands on experience with the data analysis process. I hope to grow from the foundation of skills this opportunity gave me in order to become a well-rounded data anaylst and data interpreter.  
  
I hope to be given an opportunity that allows me to further my knowledge and continously grow and change for the better.  
### Goal

I aim to grow and improve these skills mentioned by working through case studies of various topics in order to become a well-rounded analyst. I will be experimenting and dabbling in different skills in each case study to, all while working with topics I love and have interest in. 
My goal is not perfection, it is improvement.

### Statement of Originality
Here, I am to post insights and conclusions based on data from open source databases. This work is my own and the origins of the data will be posted with my conclusions. Thank you.
