### Portfolio
 
Here, I will house projects I have completed with the data analysis process. These case studies will showcase a variety of my skills and improvement along the way, all while dabbling in topics that I love and have interests in!


### About Me
Hi there! I am a curious individual looking to gain experience in data analysis in order to reach valuable insights. I want to explore some questions and unknowns by finding trends, patterns and order in some messy and chaotic data.
I am a recent graduate from Western Washington University where I completed a Bachelor's of Science in mathematics, accompanied by minors in phyics and astronomy. My education has allowed me to develop a thinking process that stems from critical thinking and problem solving. This sometimes can lead to a surprising number of a variety of different questions, which only drives my curiousity further.

I also recently completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, which allowed me to build a solid foundation for the data analysis process and skills. Since earning this certificate, I have gained a large appreciation for the art of data-story telling and being able to interpret the data honestly and effectively.

Interests wise, I love numbers and I love science. With that being said, data science only seems like a natural next step to make for my transition into the professional setting. Not only am I now equipped to address questions I have been wanting answers to, but I can reach insights and create exciting deliverables for others and their interests as well based on the story the data wants to tell.

I also love art and opportunities to be creative. So when I discovered the ability to create aesthetically pleasing visualizations and the opportunities it could present, I became eager to explore this skill further as well, while mastering presentation for all to understand.

### Goal

I aim to grow and improve these skills mentioned by working through case studies of various topics in order to become a well-rounded analyst. I will be experimenting and dabbling in different areas in each case study to.
My goal is not perfection, it is improvement.

### Statement of Originality
Here, I am to post insights and conclusions based on data from open source databases. This work is my own and the origins of the data will be posted with my conclusions. Thank you.
